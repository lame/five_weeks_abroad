  **Ryan** » A software engineer with wanderlust who convinced his job to let him work abroad for 5 weeks

  **Sara** » A pragmatic nurse who did not think this was possible

  **Penny** » A majestic pug along for the ride hoping to find tapas on Spanish sidewalks

A blog focused on travel enjoyment, tips and tricks for navigating trips with pets and long term stays, and a smidge or digital nomad writing.
