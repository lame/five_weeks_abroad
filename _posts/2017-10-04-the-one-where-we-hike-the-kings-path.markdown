We had learned about a spectacular tourist attraction not far from us here in Malaga, from our friend [Geoffrey](https://www.geoffchandler.com/). He insisted we take a trip to El Caminito del Rey before we left Andalusia. The Caminito is a walkway built along the cliff that follows El Chorro gorge. The original path was built in 1905 to help hydroelectric workers access the dam and move materials throughout the mountain. As the years passed, this original walkway fell into disrepair and was deemed “the most dangerous path in the world” after several hikers and rock climbers lost their lives attempting to traverse it.

Fortunately for us, a new walkway had been constructed and reopened in 2015. It preserved the old walkway, having been built directly above it. So we did some research and figured out how to get to El Caminito del Rey.  


Tuesday morning, just a 50-minute train ride north of Malaga we reached El Chorro. Shuttle buses from the train station ferry tourists back and forth to the northern entrance of the Caminito.

From the bus stop we made our way towards the northern access for the Camino, hiking along the river and taking in some spectacular views.

This first leg of the route is 2.7km (1.7 mi) long. Although, there is a shorter route that leads to the northern access, which we never spotted. 


Once at the entrance to the path, we gathered with the group of people being let in for the noon slot. It seems that they allow visitors entry every 15 minutes for safety reasons.


We had bought our tickets online at the [El Caminito del Rey website][caminito_del_rey_documents] for the unguided entrance. The website offers both guided and unguided tickets, as well as the option to purchase tickets for the bus ride from the train station to the northern entrance.  


We picked up our hairnets and hardhats and were on our way!

It’s like we were stepping into the Honey Bunches of Oats factory.

After this checkpoint, begins the newly renovated Caminito del Rey. The 2.9km (1.8 mi) boardwalk brought us through the narrow gorge navigating us along the cliffside about 350 feet above the river.

We were presented with breathtaking views and an unforgettable experience.

About midway through the path, we spotted a train passing through the mountain across from the Caminito.

We snapped pictures of each other on either ends of a curved part of the path.

In certain areas you can spot the old walkway under the new path.

The end of the wooden walkway is marked by a hanging bridge that allows you to cross the gorge. This one is not for the fearful of heights or those with vertigo since the bridge swings a bit from the powerful winds coming through the mountains.

Honestly, I wish I had had more time on the bridge. Even though I’m too afraid to rock climb or boulder, I found the hanging bridge exhilarating. I told Ryan, “lets do it again!” Unfortunately, at that point, there were too many tourists around to run back to the other side. 


This was the end of El Caminito del Rey and we only had the last bit to hike to the southern access. It was a short 2.1km (1.3mi) trek there and relinquished our noggin protectors. The exit of the Caminito still rewarded us with a great view of the end of the gorge and the aquamarine river.

The entire hike from bus stop to the southern access spanned 7.7km (4.8mi). The Caminito del Rey website advises to allow 3-5 hours to walk the path with enough time to take it in. We completed it in 2.5 hours and had enough time to catch the earlier 3pm train back to Malaga. 


We were starved after the long walk and found some nice junk food at the train station back in Malaga.

A little taste of home is always good for the soul. 

Hiking El Caminito del Rey was an unforgettable experience, a true hallmark of Spanish geography. I hope others will take advantage of this attraction and take in some of the most spectacular views during their vacation to Andalusia too.
