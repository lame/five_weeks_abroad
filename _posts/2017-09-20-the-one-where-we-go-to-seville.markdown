We’re now in Malaga and settling into that laid back Malagueño style of life. Our weekend in Seville went as quick as it came and we wish we had more time there. It’s a beautiful city. We were so lucky to have found it during a cold front where it wasn’t in the 100s the entire time (or ever) while we were there.

On Saturday we rented bikes and decided to tour the city with only Google Maps and our guide book on Andalucia. This turned out to be a very good idea if you know how to navigate the maze of medieval European streets. But anything is possible with Google Maps, right? More on this later.

We biked our way into El Centro de Seville to check out the bullring, La Plaza de Toros de la Maestranza. Neither of us are exactly fans of this gruesome sport but much of Spanish culture and history is embedded into bullfighting, so we figured a tour of the ring couldn’t hurt.

Inside, the tour guide led us around to different exhibition rooms that detailed the art and history of bullfighting. Also on display were the heads of the bulls defeated by famous bullfighters, trapping them forever in the place they were killed for sport.

We were then led into the arena where they released one of those bulls and we all ran around for our lives.

Just kidding. But if that was part of the tour, I know people would still pay to go.

So the bullring was neat to see but we both agreed we wouldn’t want to watch one live. We’re not Hemingway.

I had read about the oldest bar in Sevilla in our guidebook, so we biked there next. We would return here at night but I felt I had to get a picture of the front if it in daylight.
Take a look at the year the bar was founded.

1670! This bar in Seville is older than America! So yeah, that blew my mind.

From El Rinconcillo we biked east towards an Indian restaurant to get some lunch. We feasted. There are no pictures of this because we were elbow deep into some Tikka Masala and garlic naan.
After lunch is where we found out we were not yet experts in navigating medieval European streets. Let me present you with Exhibit A.

In my defense, I had been following Ryan for a while before I asked to see the map. We had a pretty good laugh about it at the outskirts of town. Still makes me chuckle. That’s got to be the best picture I’ve taken on this trip so far.

We made our way back (thanks to my amazing powers of orientation) to the Airbnb and reunited with Penny.

For those of you that follow @kuhladventures on Instagram you’ve already seen a similar picture and know that Ryan is the nerdiest person I know (and love very much). To explain why there were Storm Troopers here in the first place, we think there was a board game block party happening in the background. Nerds are everywhere and anywhere, even in the ex-red light district of Seville where we happened to be staying (unbeknownst to us before we booked).

That night we made it out to “The Mushrooms” as we liked to call them. Right in the middle of Seville is a massive wooden structure that looks very similar to huge mushrooms. It’s actually called the Metropol Parasol and was designed by German architect Jürgen Mayer. The view from the walkway on the mushrooms is lovely.

We ended the night back at El Rinconcillo with some Rioja y jamon Iberico. The oldest bar in Sevilla also has the oldest bartenders inside of it. Despite their age, they were quick at taking down orders from the dozens of patrons visiting the famous establishment.

If those hams hanging from the ceiling look sweaty, it’s because they were.


We had a wonderful time in Seville. If you find yourself in Spain, I highly recommend a visit. Be prepared for some heat, beautiful architecture, and confusing streets.
