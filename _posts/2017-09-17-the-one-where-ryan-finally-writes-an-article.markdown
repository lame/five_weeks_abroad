As a bit of a change, I wanted to talk for a bit about the process of working abroad and getting to a place where this
was possible. I think a lot of software developers and engineers talk a lot about being a 'digital nomad', or a person
who can maintain a consistent income anywhere in the world. I usually see this being said in conjunction with mention of
Tim Ferris, freelance working, and a tinge of arrogance.


I went for something a little different, I wanted to do the digital nomad life with a more traditional 9-to-5 type job.
I think in the long run working at a larger tech company has better long term viability. I'm still learning core skills
and valuable insight from working with far more experiences devs that I wouldn't be able to get if I was head honcho,
it's the little fish in a big pond strategy. While less flexible than being a freelancer, the tech giants like Google,
Facebook and WordPress have brought an expectation of remote work for the tech workforce, and this should be taken
advantage of to the fullest!


Tim Farris had some interesting insight into this in 'The 4-Hour Work Week' where he pushes the reader to work remotely
more often and to engage in deep work while simultaneously reducing the total hours of work per week. I can see the
logic behind this for sure, but it take a lot of dicipline to actually employ. I've been slowly adding more remote
working days to my regular work schedule to test my own dicipline with this newfound freedom while still close to the
office; working from the couch or quiet coffee shops. This was integral to becoming better at working remote, 0 to 100
is a strategy that is setting you up for failure. Another lucky coincidence is that my job has offices in several
timezones. This puts a need for people to communicate asynchronously through slack (hopefully) or email (if they're mas
at you I guess). This culture of employees working between offices and timezones was promising for a more extreme
arrangement or working overseas.


A big part of the pitch was in setting up strict guidelines of availability and response time in case of
an incident or outage. Fall back plans if my laptop were to break and a contingency plan was if things didn't work
out. With all this outlined it seemed to be pretty low risk, if the laptop gets stolen by gypsies, buy a new one and
expense it. Be available half the day on west-coast time, be no more than two hours away from your computer in case of
an emergency. Done.

 
Several months of working remote a day or two a week went well, contingency plan was made, nothing left but the big pitch, I want to
work from Europe for 5 weeks! My manager vouched for me and asked up the chain of command. Everybody seemed a little dubious but
okay with the transition.


Leading up to the trip it was very important to get all my tasks in order, #everything in it's place# as the French say.
I was assigned two large projects and made a point to get all the relevant information I could think of, reviewed and
re-reviewed the tickets so I wouldn't be held up with missing informaition forcing me to make meetings or shape my
schedule too much around Pacific Time.


Then it's off-we-go to Spain for 5 weeks! I'm a little over a week in as of now and I think it seems to be going well.
I've been getting what I think to be more work done and have managed to stay more relaxed and focused in the new
surroundings than I had anticipated. With a solid 3 hour pre-breakfast stint and another 3 or so hours after dinner I
have managed to keep my workload on par with being in the office, so I guess Tim Ferris might be onto something.


We'll see how the remainder of the trip goes!


Stay tuned for a write up of how we got Penny (our pug) to be able to join us overseas for our trip! Spoiler alert it
rhymes with paperwork and the Benjamins.
