I apologize for the use of the third person in that title, I know I’m not Elmo. I’m keeping this one short because not much happened over the past two days due to a nasty cold I acquired.


On Monday, we tried out the tapas bar down the street from the apartment. I’ve got to say, despite feeling crummy, there’s nothing like midday sangria. As true tourists, we have to try all that Andalucia has to offer. Honestly, I’m pretty convinced there’s no alcohol in any of the sangria they sell here. It all tastes like fruity Sprite to me.

And I finally got to try REAL Manchego cheese, made in Spain, while in Spain. Redemption cheese for the win!! It was alright. It was missing merry parents sharing red wine under the moonlight outside in my mother’s garden, like I’m used to while eating Manchego cheese.


The rest of Monday was basically slept away; thanks to a mixture of leftover jet lag and this sickness.
We ended the day with a delicious dinner by the best (American) chef in Spain, Señor Kuhl!

Ryan has mastered pasta algliolio from the movie Chef, thanks to this video from [Youtube][youtube]. If you’re wondering what our kitchen here looks like, wonder no more!

The kitchen is minimalistic. Two electric stove top ranges sit on a counter beside the sink, and underneath you find the washing machine (no, not the dishwasher). To the left of that is the junior refrigerator. Junior because it's larger than a mini-fridge yet smaller than a full grown fridge. There’s also a microwave, above the fridge. And no oven.


Cooking in this mini-malistic kitchen has been more feasible than anticipated. The limited storage forces us to buy fresher ingredients, and not just boxed foods. The abundance of fresh produce markets and their walkability makes it easy to grab only what we need and not overbuy. The actual cooking is also not terrible. You’d think that going from 4 to 2 ranges would take some getting used to. However, if you aren’t meal prepping and are cooking for two, then it’s actually the perfect stove top size. ~~Ryan disagrees with this.~~


Sometimes I wonder if you suddenly left everything you’re accustomed to behind and had to adapt to a life with less, would you find out what truly brings you joy? Sometimes simpler is better. This time, I can confirm. Cooking in this kitchenette is like a breath of fresh air. Would it be different if we weren’t on vacation? Maybe. Maybe not.


We did splurge on some flan. Because like I said, we have no oven; and proper flan requires an oven to make.
