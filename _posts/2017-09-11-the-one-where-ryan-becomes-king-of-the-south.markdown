description: Getting a taste for the wine's of souther Spain like Moscatel and Pajarete, a visit to Castillo de Gibralfaro

Before I get to that, I have to tell you about this delicious Spanish wine called Moscatel. It’s a rich and syrupy, Sherry-like wine, made from Moscatel grapes. It tastes of molasses and happiness. Normally, sweet dessert wine is not our thing. But we had met two friendly locals, Jeronimo and Geoffrey, and were accompanying them for a drink (or two).

As you can see, the Moscatel is served in small glasses to sip just like Sherry. They also served Pajarete, another wine found in Malaga, and Vermouth. All three are poured out of small wine barrels. I wish I had taken more pictures of the place, but have no fear, I’ll make sure to take more when we return (we plan to go back soon!).


We got to learn more about our new friends over a night of sipping wine and beers. Jero, is a young Argentinian now living in Spain for 16 years; and Geoffrey (pronounced Jeffrey, who we had now nicknamed Jefe) is a fellow American from Oregon. Soon it was 6:30 in the morning and we were ready for bed.


The next day, we woke up at 2pm refreshed and ready to see more of Malaga.

We decided to venture out to Castillo de Gibralfaro, a Moorish castle that sits atop a hill overlooking Malaga and the Mediterranean sea.

We took the No. 35 bus up to the castle since we were feeling ~~lazy~~ smart. It felt as if we were in an episode of Game of Thrones, in a Dornish fortress.

Here, Ryan made his claim to the throne and became King of the South.

However, he didn’t realize that he might not fit in his new castle.
