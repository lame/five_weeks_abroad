*Or How We Learned to Stop Worrying and Trust the Stamp*


While we were in Paris earlier this year we met an amazing couple, Chelsea and Trey Stone [Our Steppin Stones Blog]. They were two expats in their 30s that decided to move to Spain and fulfil their dream of living abroad for a year, bringing along their Pekinese Cashman. Meeting them felt like a sign, giving us the inspiration for our current trip. Before meeting Chelsea and Trey, we had no idea that you could even bring a pet into Europe from the US. It’s not something that we really ever sat and talked about until after we had met them.

Knowing that it was actually possible made it that much more attractive to travel with Penny. If you already know me, you know how much I love this furry little beast and leaving her behind to travel anywhere is heart wrenching. So when Ryan proposed the idea of us traveling to Spain for five weeks, my one stipulation was that we bring Penny with us.

I wanted to write this post to explain our first hand experience and what research was needed to complete the process. Upon doing our own research for Penny, we put together what we thought we needed from various Pet-Travel websites, the CDC, and USDA websites. However, we never found anyone’s own experience going through this process detailed and validating if what we thought we needed was correct.


So here it is, our process of ~~smuggling~~ completely legally getting Penny into the European Union.


![Penny's First Pee in Spain][penny_peetime]


When you Google “getting dog into Spain from US” the first result is a link to PetTravel.com<sup>[1]</sup>, a company that assists in the relocation of pets internationally. They were our best reference throughout this process since they detail exactly what is and what is not needed for travel into Spain (as well as other countries).


Side note: Thanks to the Stones, we knew that Spain’s requirements were basically the simplest for importing a dog into the EU. Going through Spain, France or Germany will allow you get your pet in, and once in, a pet passport will allow uncomplicated travel throughout the EU. If you were going into the UK, for instance, the process is far more complicated and if you don’t have the proper paperwork, could result in a required quarantine period for your pet upon arrival.

According to PetTravel.com we knew that the first thing Penny needed was the correct microchip. Luckily, she was already microchipped and her vet confirmed that the right one was in. The next thing was for her to have a current rabies vaccine. Penny had been vaccinated last June 2016 with a 3-yr vaccine and Spain recognizes 3 yr rabies vaccines, so we were good on that as well.


The process for Spain does require that the pet receive the rabies vaccine AFTER being microchipped with “an ISO 11784/11785 compliant 15 digit pet microchip” (1). We didn’t have a problem with this part but if Penny had not had the proper chip in already, she would have had to get the right one placed, be re-vaccinated, and have to wait 21 days before traveling. So this process has be started with at least two to three months notice if there’s already a set travel date, just to have a comfortable window of time.


Since the US is recognized as a rabies-controlled country, Penny did not require a Rabies Titer Test. The next step was getting her health certificate. According to PetTravel.com, because we were traveling from the US, “the veterinarian must be accredited by the USDA and the health certificate must be endorsed by the State USDA office.” We simply called up our vet to check this, and the USDA website has some helpful info on this too<sup>[2]</sup>.


Another side note, we believe that PetTravel.com makes it’s business off selling these forms in their blank state to users as a service. These forms are available for free on the USDA website<sup>[3]</sup> and any vet that you visit to get the form completed will have the form available as well. No need to pay for it!


![Penny's Health Certificate][penny_health_cert]


The health certificate needed to be completed and endorsed by the USDA within 10 days of our arrival date. This is an important distinction if your flight spans two days due to timezones. We made an appointment with our vet to fit that timeline. Our travel date was set for September 6th with arrival on September 7th, so we had to keep in mind that the USDA office would be closed for Labor Day, September 4th.


We looked up the nearest state office for the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) through their website<sup>[4]</sup> and crossed our fingers that it wasn’t in Sacramento. There is one located in El Segundo directly south of LAX. We were in luck!


We had called the USDA APHIS state office to see if we could make an appointment to endorse our paperwork. Due to the amazing efficiency and dedication of government agencies, they were open Monday-Friday from 7:30am-11am. Hope you have a sick-day handy for work.


Ryan took Penny to the vet to get the health certificate completed the Thursday before our trip. That next day, I showed up at the APHIS office at 7am and met six other people in line. Living in LA means getting everything done before the birds are up and traffic gets going, if you really mean business.


While in line, I got to talk to some of the other folks going through the same process. There was a young Irish gal that suddenly had her work visa revoked and was stuck figuring out how to get herself and her dog back to Ireland within a week (thanks Trump). Remember I noted that the UK is hard to get your pet into, well Ireland apparently is worse. (No, Ireland is not part of the UK, just Northern Ireland).


Anyway, after 2-3 hours and about $30 later I had Penny’s health certificate stamped by an official at the USDA APHIS office and she was set to fly! I gotta say, the lady getting everyone’s paperwork in order was super nice. Overall a refreshing experience for a government office. I really mean this, for once I’m not being sarcastic here. She was really, really nice.


Another potential pitfall in this whole endeavor was the flight. We booked a direct flight to Spain to avoid having to get Penny’s paperwork for several countries. The only direct flights from LAX to anywhere in Spain were with Iberia and Norwegian airlines. We ended up taking Norwegian Airlines for the less expensive fare. A direct flight is a must when traveling with a pet as the rules get strange and expensive with multiple hops in other countries. US law dictates that a flight starting or terminating in the US must comply with the service animal requirements mandated by the FAA, meaning that the airline has to accept service animals (including ESA) on the flight regardless of company policy. Keep in mind that ESA certificates are only valid for one year within receiving it, and the airlines will check this date. We’ll come back to this.



After thoroughly reading through the Norwegian Airlines pet policy<sup>[5]</sup>, we determined that Penny should be good-to-go for a fee that we normally pay to the airline to carry her onboard with us. After booking the flight we called Norwegian to reserve a seat for her and determine what the fee would be. They kindly informed us that they do not transport pets internationally between the US and Europe. We asked that they cancel our booking and we would look for another flight, which they told us was impossible as we hadn’t purchased the more expensive tickets that one could cancel. This is where Penny’s valid ESA certificate comes into the mix, because of that and the direct flight we were able to bring her in the cabin despite Norwegian’s corporate policy of not transporting pets internationally. In addition Norwegian is not allowed to charge a fee for a service animal’s travels under FAA policy, so that was a plus!

Okay, so this post has gone on for far longer than I had intended. So I will end with our experience getting into Spain.


After a sweaty 11 hour flight, we got off the plane, showed our passports at Border Patrol, picked up our bags and made our way to Customs (en español: Aduana). This is where they quickly reviewed our health certificate and scanned Penny’s microchip. So yes, they DO check.


Then we were officially and legally IN SPAIN WITH PENNY.


“I want to thank the academy, and my parents for their continued support through this process. But most importantly, I want to thank the lady at APHIS, whose wonderful enthusiasm for her work gave me the motivation to not give up even when I thought we would all get stopped at customs in Spain. Thank you all!!’


![Pennys in Trains][penny_train]


Yeah, that’s seriously how I felt. Like Jennifer Lawrence at the Oscars. Except without all the tripping.


Since this went on forever, I will detail how we got Penny a cute Pet Passport here in Malaga and how we are getting her back to the US, in a future post. No worries, it’s a much simpler process.

I hope this was a helpful and informative post for those curious on how to import your pet to the EU. It should not be used as an official reference source, but the handy dandy websites included, should be.
