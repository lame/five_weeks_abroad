Yes, DORNE. The Alcázar in Seville is where GoT filmed scenes for the Water Gardens in Dorne for Season 5. We’re pretty big Game of Thrones fans (who isn’t?) and once I learned about this nearby filming location, we had to get our butts to Seville. 
So we did!


Friday morning we hopped a train from Malaga and made it to Seville in just over 2 hours. Penny enjoyed her first train ride ever, and it was well documented.

Did you know that Andalucia produces around 20% of the world’s olive oil? This region has olive trees for days!

Once we arrived at our destination, we set out for the Alcázar. 


We found a monument of Miguel de Cervantes and had to stop for a quick photo op. My mom always spoke of her school days and how much she dreaded reading Don Quixote, equating it to Shakespeare in Spanish. It’s on my reading list..for some distant future.

The Alcázar of Seville is a medieval Islamic palace. If I had to explain the Alcázar in one word, it would be magnificent. The architecture is eye candy and you could easily spend an entire day in the gardens. I mean, just look at this place.

No wonder the Game of Thrones team decided to film here. I didn’t want to leave.

Have I mentioned my love of maps? Ancient maps are the best. There was this impressive twenty-foot tapestry of ancient Europe inside the Alcázar.

It shows Spain facing Africa as well as Sicily. Here it is again.

All in all, Seville is wonderful. Even the weather is great. We got here during a “cold front.” It has been in the mid 80s all day. 


We will be in Seville for the weekend, so more updates on this awesome city coming soon!
