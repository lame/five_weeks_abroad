Our friend Geoffrey here in Malaga let us know about one of the gems nearby. A small beach town known as Nerja about an hour east, where we could go kayaking and check out some beautiful rock formations. Geoffrey has been living in Malaga for over a year and is a great guide to the area; you can check out his website about things to do around Malaga [here](https://www.malagaflow.com/en/). 

Friday morning, Ryan found out that we could get to Nerja by one of Malaga’s regional buses. We quickly searched for the next bus out and made our way to the station. We bought two roundtrip bus tickets to Nerja for less than €18 and were on our way! 

The bus took a coastal highway very akin to the Pacific Coast Highway. After an hour and a half, we were in Nerja. We had Googled the closest place where we could rent some kayaks which turned out to be only a 13 minute walk from the bus stop and right on the beach.

We couldn’t believe how beautiful the small town was and how simple it had been to get there.

During our trot to the beach we even found a bit of home.

Once we got to the kayak rental shop, we found out they had excursions to Maro beach, not too far from Nerja. We booked ourselves into the next tour and would wait it out sunbathing on the beach. 

But first, coffee! We decided we needed some caffeine.  Being in Spain has made us a bit caffeine dependent. I blame the accessibility and low, low prices.

After sunbathing, it was time for our kayak tour of Nerja! We met our instructor, Sevilla (born in the city and named after it), who reviewed kayaking basics in Spanish, using words like “dynamic” to describe the flow of rowing. Once in the water, we waited for the rest of our group and grew more and more excited about our excursion. 

Sevilla led us along the coastal cliffs, bringing us into small caves where mountain water fed into the Mediterranean. We passed junior waterfalls, impressive rock formations, and spotted a few mountain goats above us on the bluffs.

Sevilla explained that the water in this area was clearer, cleaner, and a bit colder since the mountain water fed into it. You can see this here.

We rowed to Moro beach, passing what Sevilla called a “hippie commune” of people that live freely in the mountains and live off the land. Honestly, I’d love to be them. I couldn’t think of a better place to squat. 

We stopped in the water to take a dip in the Mediterranean. A bit chilly, it felt like I was in a natural spring and not in the ocean.

We then made our way back to the shore at Nerja. It was too early yet for our bus ride back, so we found a nice bar to hang out at and watch the sunset.

We’ve learned that in Malaga (or generally all of Spain) mojitos are prepared very strong and with dark rum. After two rounds of mojitos, it was time to make our way back to the bus stop. We may have underestimated how much time we had and briskly walked all the way back. It’s okay though, because buses are always late.

We made it with time to spare since the bus was indeed a bit late.

We could have squeezed in another drink. 

I love spontaneous trips like these. When we travel, we rarely have more than just our flights planned. Sometimes this is a bad thing, like when we realize we could have gotten more out of our time by meticulously planning. Most of the time, however, it results as a wonderful experience after just a bit of same-day planning.
