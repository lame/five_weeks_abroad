We’re back from an active weekend of kayaking, hiking with sandals losing their grip, train trips and bus rides. On Friday we revisited Nerja since our first experience went so well. We took an early bus ride there to get the most out of our time. Our early arrival allowed us to walk along an empty beach and scout out some beach chairs with a bit of shade.

After a morning of sunbathing, we set out once again into the Mediterranean. This time Ryan hopped on a paddle board while I followed along on my kayak. After two hours on our own in the ocean, we made it back to shore and it was near time for our bus ride back home. Ryan had been wanting to try espeto, a local snack sold on the beach of fire roasted sardines on a skewer. So we grabbed our order to go and made it back to the bus stop. Once back in Malaga, we picked up Penny from the pet sitter and proceeded to collapse.

Nerja was just the appetizer for our weekend in Ronda. Early Saturday morning we packed our things and our fur child and hopped on the Media Distancia train. Two hours into my Game of Thrones book, we arrived! It was too early to check into our hotel, so we dropped off our bags and grabbed some lunch. During lunch, Penny felt the sudden need to defend her newly claimed territory where tapas are abundant, and made several attempts to launch herself at the dog sitting at a nearby table. I’m not entirely blaming Penny though, since I learned that the other dog’s name was “Chispa” which translates to “spark”, and what well mannered dog is called Spark?

Anyway, after the drama of Penny’s traumatic self defense tactics had settled down, it was time to check in. I made sure with the snooty hotel clerk that we were getting a room with a terraza, since that was the deal we scored on Hotels.com after our Airbnb was cancelled. I was adamant about this since it only cost a few extra euros and was a great find.

It turned out that my pestering had worked and we arrived to our room with a terrace and a breathtaking view of the Sierra Nevadas.

Penny stretched her sore legs and took in the views as well.

Once we settled into our new home for the weekend, we went out to find El Puente Nuevo (The New Bridge). And find it we did.

Along the cliff adjacent to the bridge there is a path you can take to walk down the gorge and underneath the bridge. We had left Penny in the hotel room to rest, so we traversed down the path freely. Ryan had the right shoes on, but I was wearing flat sandals. The stone path was made smooth from all its visitors so I was careful to go down the slope with what little traction I had left under my feet. Despite that, we made it the entire way down without trouble, crossing under the bridge and hopping on rocks to cross the stream running through the gorge. The view of the bridge towering above us was impressive, as if you could feel the weight of the earth surround you.

Ryan managed to snap a profile-worthy picture of me in front of the bridge.

Thanks boo!




We got back to the hotel just in time to take a dip in the pool during sunset.

Later we cracked open a bottle of Rioja and kept Penny company on the terrace while we listened to the festivities of a wedding taking place below in the courtyard.

Sunday morning we grabbed an early breakfast and set out to explore the rest of “big” Ronda. We walked around el Pueblo Blanco until we found ourselves at El Puente Viejo (The Old Bridge).

It was a particularly sunny day and we stopped at a small park, across from the bridge, to let Penny cool off.

I got to talking with a local that had also brought his pups to romp around. He explained that Ronda is halved by the gorge, El Tajo, and connected by three bridges: El Puente Romano, El Puente Viejo, and El Puente Nuevo, built most recently (as of 3 centuries ago). He went on to explain that there is a path along the inside of the cliff walls called El Camino Secreto (the secret walkway) that the queen would take down to bathe in the river.

We heeded his advice to continue south and check out the ancient Arab baths. We encountered yet another slick stone path and were rewarded with some amazing views of Ronda.

The town of Ronda is what I always imagined small medieval towns in Europe to be like. Sitting atop a mountain, at the very edge of a cliffside with amazing views and lovely white homes with terracotta roofs. I was so taken back by its beauty and the opportunity to explore it with my small family. The imagery of Ronda is what I will try to invoke whenever I am feeling overwhelmed with the stresses of life or work to help me stay calm and centered.

I want to share some of that beautiful imagery via postcards. If you made it to the end of this post and wish to get a postcard of big beautiful Ronda, please send your mailing address over private message to @kuhladventures on Instagram or via my Facebook page. I will send them out from Spain before our departure but can’t promise they will get to you before the end of the year. That was a joke, give them some time to cross that large pond.

Hasta Luego!
