        <p>The One where I buy some bad cheese</p>

<p>We made it to Malaga Friday morning after a short flight from Barcelona. Ryan was awestruck by the floor cleaning techniques at the Barcelona airport.</p>

<p>Penny got to ride outside her carrier for all but five minutes of the flight. Here she is begging to get out.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/fiveweeksabroad/09092017/penny_in_carrier.jpg" alt="Penny in carrier on airplane" /></p>

<p>Normally, she doesn’t make a peep, but I’m guessing she couldn’t contain her excitement either.</p>

<p>Since we got into Malaga before the Airbnb was ready, we dropped our bags off and headed for a stroll around town. We found out that Churros y Chocolate are as prominent in Malaga as Starbucks in a college town. Clearly, we had to stop for some.</p>

<p>Few times does a plan go so perfectly for non-Type A people, such as us, that we must pat ourselves on the back. So far, this was the whole trip here but the cherry on top is finding our Airbnb. Look at this beauty. Here is Ryan again for scale.</p>

<p>It’s even got Penny’s seal of approval.</p>

<p>Once we were settled into the apartment, we decided to go back out to get our bearings down. We walked to Old Town and noticed most stores were closed and not a lot of people were out and about. It was too early in the day for siesta, and just another Friday. We thought maybe it was a holiday.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/fiveweeksabroad/09092017/empty_promenade.jpg" alt="Empty town promenade" /></p>

<p>We were correct. The town of Malaga was celebrating their patron saint, the Santa Maria de la Victoria, credited by King Ferdinand for winning back the city from the Moors in 1487. We encountered the long procession where the (massive) statue is carried back to the cathedral at night.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/fiveweeksabroad/09092017/packed_promenade(1).jpg" alt="Packed town promenade" /></p>

<p>The next day we walked to el Mercado de Atarazanas, after my dad’s suggestions of the market from a Youtube video. There we found fresh seafood (mariscos), vegetables (verduras), y queso Manchego. Also a TON of Marcona almonds.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/fiveweeksabroad/09092017/almonds.jpg" alt="So many almonds!" /></p>

<p>I snatched up some Manchego cheese and jamon Iberico with much excitement. The cheese cost € 4 and I was pumped to for this treat to my palate. We had an early dinner to include the cheese. And to much dissatisfaction, I found out that either I had bought the wrong cheese, or this was the real version of Spanish Manchego that I now had to adapt to. It had was very similar to blue cheese and I don’t know about you, but that’s where I draw the line on my love of queso. Something about that awful sour mold taste is not appealing. I’m just glad we didn’t drop € 15 on that bad boy. This is how you travel though, throwing caution to the wind. Like that time I bought a whole wedge of unpasteurized cheese in London, without ever having had something so dangerous and unregulated, and didn’t die! Wouldn’t be writing this if I had…</p>
